# Weather App
Android app which uses the Open Weather Map API and location input to provide the temperature and weather condition.

The app calls: http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=
and appends the location input by the user to return a JSON which is parsed for the condition and temperature.

The display is updated to reflect the new input
